        "one": "As an experienced Software Developer with a focus on JavaScript React, Python, Django, and Node.js, I am currently seeking new opportunities in Junior Dev/Engineering roles, as well as entry-level positions and internships. With two years of industry experience under my belt, I have honed my skills in developing high-quality software solutions that meet the needs of clients and end-users alike.",
        "two":"Coming from a Somali household, I have always placed a strong emphasis on family values, and this has been reflected in my approach to my work. I have lived in a number of different locations across the United States, including Seattle, WA, and Columbus, OH, spending around seven years in each city. This has given me a broad perspective on different cultures and ways of working, and I am always eager to learn and grow both personally and professionally.",
        "three":"I am an open and personable individual who is always willing to connect with others in the industry. If you have any opportunities that you think might be a good fit for my skills and experience, please don'\tt hesitate to reach out. I would be honored to explore any potential blessings that may come my way.",
        "four":"Writing code always seemed like a chore to me but that's only because I never applied/understood what It meant to Problem solve. Problem solving is what pushed the web to where its at now. Being able to produce a clean and concise piece of code that does exactly what you intend is nothing short of satisfying; however, being able to tackle a problem and solve it...now that's the real reward."
